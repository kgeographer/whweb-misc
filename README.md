### whweb

This is the resurfacing of the **World Heritage Web** project, initiated in 2001 and mostly dormant since 2004. The hiatus had mostly to do with going to graduate school

This [archaic flash presentation](http://worldheritageweb.org) indicates the duration of that dormancy. A few working prototypes were built back then, but nothing worth showing now. In its new incarnation, __whweb__ aims to enable some interesting new ways of navigating world history, loosely anchored to designated cultural and natural heritage sites, such as those found on UNESCO's World Heritage List.

The __whweb__ project will be a setting for experimenting with various digital methods for representing our knowledge and experience of places...maybe even coming up with a new computational wrinkle or two in the realm of temporal, textual, and spatial analyses. We are interested in the overlapping meanings of _**place**_ and _**period**_, and how that could make for some interesting new ways of navigating large information stores.

World Heritage Web is _**not**_ affiliated in any way with UNESCO -- not that we wouldn't mind at some (distant) future date.
